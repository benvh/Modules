MODULES

A simple lightweight annotation based IoC Container with dependency injection.
It's sort of Spring Beans and OSGi's little down syndrome baby -> Spring Beans-like annotation config / container + OSGi like bundles (modules) without the runtime dynamic magic, ...

The container consists of 4 import parts.

1. ModuleBus (the actual container)
2. Module (an annotation which is used to "define" a Module)
3. Find (an annotation to inject dependencies -> other registered modules)
4. ModuleListener (a way to listen for module registrations and do stuff with that... useful for whiteboard pattern-like things)

When you create a ModuleBus you can make it scan certain parts of your classpath (or everything...).
It will detect the Module and Find annotations and do it's magic.
